==How to add more icons==
You are able to not only add icons by Lordicon but also your own animation exported as a .json (Bodymovin AfterEffects plugin, Lottie Files).

A quick guide on how to add more icons:
1. Install and activate a plugin.
2. Search for Lordicon tab in the menu on the left.
3. Upload a single .json or a .json object (where the keys are the names of the graphics and the value is a Lottie animation) from your hard drive
4. Go to your Gutenberg editor.
5. Click the "Plus" icon and search for Lordicon extension.
6. Search for the file name in a dropdown list that appears on the right-hand side of a screen.
7. Easily customize animation type, size or color of your interactive graphics.

== Important ==
This plugin does not install remote images or files. All files are stored inside the plugin zip file.
